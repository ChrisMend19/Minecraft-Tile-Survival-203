The event is triggered by clicking on one of the many purple "nether" portals located around the map.
Upon being triggered, the event spawns several ghasts (a new entity type) and adds lava and and nether rock
to the background. The ghasts move slower than the other entities but do extra damage to the user. The event
also edits existing entities such as the skeleton, which changes its appearance as well as its damage output.
Additionally, triggering the world event, the user gains the ability to teleport via the portals.

Partners:
Alex, Chris: pretty much responsible for the same tasks; creating multiple background, adding and removing entities,
editing previous entity behaviors, implementing pathing and movement, creating game mechanics etc.
